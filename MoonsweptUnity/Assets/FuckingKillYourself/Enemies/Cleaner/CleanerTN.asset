  displayText: "S.D.L (Sigurd\u2019s Danger Level): 5%\n\nThe Cleaners are small,
    aerial machines that were built to handle infestation within the facilities.
    They slowly roam around the building, dispensing a fog of highly concentrated
    TZP chemicals. The purpose of this fog was to kill invasive insects, however
    they seem to have long since grown resistant to it, even using it to their advantage
    at times as a place to hide.\n\nWhen first encountering this machine, we saw
    tons of thick fog, so we decided to take a risk and venture through it. We couldn\u2019t
    see a thing,  and we could barely breathe. It seems to give a much stronger effect
    compared to our TZP inhalers, and we struggled to walk well after. Once we got
    to the other side of the fog, we encountered the cleaner, releasing the gas as
    it sporadically flew around. When one of us struck the machine, it released a
    large amount of the chemical and quickly darted away.\n\nThere seems to be no
    evidence of who made these devices."
