  displayText: "S.D.L (Sigurd\u2019s Danger Level): 65%\n\nThis joke of a machine
    is what I've come to call the Mobile Turret.\n\nIt patrols the halls of the facilities,
    beaming a red spotlight from the tip of its barrel. It aimlessly roams around,
    until it spots a person. Once it gets within a short range of its target, it
    stops moving, aims, then starts firing. Thankfully, it\u2019s much weaker in
    damage and slower to lock on than a normal turret. However, the turret also seems
    to have a tighter, longer range than its stationary counterpart, able to gun
    down entire an entire hallway. It seems to stop attempting to aim once it begins
    firing, just shooting indiscriminately in that direction. However, still keep
    your guard up around this thing, for if you underestimate it, your life may come
    to an end quickly.\n\nThe exterior of the machine seems to be identical to the
    stationary turrets we find around the facilities, and its mobile mount has no
    identifying information on who may have modified it."
