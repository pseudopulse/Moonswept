  displayText: "BUTLER\n\nSigurd's danger level: 70%\n\nTheres no file on ths one so i'm MAKING it myself. we keep finding these stinky freaks in the mansion, they wont talk to us, they dont even pay attention to us and they look like deflated ballloons. the smell is like rotten meat, it's so bad it puts richard to shame. i hear flies buzzing around inside their bodies. Jess said she saw something crawl out of its eye socket and go back in. \n\nI don't know what to make of this man\n\nthey just walk aroun and sweep the floor, I guess thats why the mansion is so clean. At least they do their job. But I swear the stinky freaks stare at me when I'm not looking\n\nupdate: They chased Rich with a knife. we didnt see it, but he says when he got into the room, the butler just took out its broom and started sweeping like nothing happened. So we're all sticking together from now on. Screw these butlers! Now i have to stay closer to rich and he probably pissed in his suit"
