  displayText: "COIL-HEADS\n\nSigurd's danger level: 80%\n\nScientific name: Vir colligerus\nVir colligerus, or colloquially named Coil-heads, are a recent discovery and have not been studied extensively due to their extreme unpredictability and dangerous properties. They have been known to combust into flames when being dissected or even deactivated, and they carry dangerously high levels of radioactive particles. Due to this and other reasons, it has been highly speculated they were created as biological weapons of war, although this has not been proven.\n\nCoil-heads' visual appearance is that of a bloody mannequin with its head connected by a spring. Their defining behavioral characteristic is to stop when being looked at. However, this does not appear to be a hard-and-fast rule. When they encounter a loud or bright light they sometimes appear to enter a long reset mode. \nJust stare at htem or use a stun grenade! - Sigurd\n\n"
