  displayText: "EARTH LEVIATHAN\n\nSigurd's danger level: 2% cause they can't hide from the ship cmaeras!!\n\nScientific name: Hemibdella-gigantis\nThe reverently named Earth Leviathan, of the family Piscicolidae, is one of the largest invertibrates found around the Thistle Nebula. None have been captured, so not much is known of their biology. \n\nThey seem to behave as predators. It's speculated they can burrow as far as 40 meters underground, judging by the incredible excavations they can leave behind. They can detect even the slightest vibrations, and for this reason it's not recommended to stay still if they are nearby; that is a myth. Instead, if you hear them burrowing, retrace your steps."
