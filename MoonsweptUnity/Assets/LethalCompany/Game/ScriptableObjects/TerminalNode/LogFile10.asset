The new crew member is named Lucas and he is so confused and scared a ll the time, what a baby, at least he doesnt smell like a monster.\r its been so sunny even though its september, and these suits dont take it well\nok so desmond \"traced the call\" and found out theres a group of people somewhere else that pretends to call us from the company building. they are across the whole solar system !! why would they be so far away.\r\n\nDesmond says he doesnt know, but i think. What if there really is a big monster in the company building like the voice told me on the wlakie talkie? They trapped it, and we feed it to keep it tame. i just wanted a stupid job!!!!! \n\n"
