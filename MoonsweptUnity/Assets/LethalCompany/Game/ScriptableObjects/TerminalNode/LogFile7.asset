  displayText: "date: September 13, 1968\n\nfor some reason i was the one who had to call the company number to report the acciddent. they were too scared to do it. It was the same fake voice i remember from the interview on the phone at home and the stupid training videos. but it heard what i said i think, cause it said they would contact the family and find a replacement and something e lse. It talked so fast.\n\n\nI learned you can hear the screams all the time in the walkie talkie when you;re  at the wall of the Company building. they didnt believe me, well now they do. It sounds just like when i heard it a couple weeks ago. They want to quit. I said I'm not a coward. I just got this job\n\n"
