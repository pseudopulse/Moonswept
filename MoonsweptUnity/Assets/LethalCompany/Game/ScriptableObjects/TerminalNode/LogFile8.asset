  displayText: "I talked ot a voice on the walkie talkie, it was like a part of the screams. he told me the Golden planet actually existed, its not a legend. and he told me it didn't just hit a meteor. He said the planet was swallowed up by the \"beast\", and they were in its body being diggested. i asked what the beast is, and he said he didnt know!. he said it ate the planet and they forgot everything. \r\n\r\ni couldnt get him to stop talking. but i said he was on the other side of a big wall and i could get him out. i said he was inside the building. and thats when he started freaking out/. i couldn't make out a word, I think he said something about \"spitting out the rinds\" So i just turned it off. what a wack\n\r\nJess says the golden planet is just a story. I said  I KNOW, I'm not an idiot. Well she said i should quit, and she quits if i do. so she s staying\n\n"
