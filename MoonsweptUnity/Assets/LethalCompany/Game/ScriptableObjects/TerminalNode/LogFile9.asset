We arent taking any risks anymore, we dont get as much but it feels safer, and ive gotten better sleep. but its still ass. i can still smell Rich i swear to gosh he smelled that bad\n\n\ni was talking about how the voice on the phone sounded fake. Then Desmond got this weird idea. he's the wizard and all so he thinks theres a way to use the phone call i made to the company number to find ourt where the voice comes from. i dont know why hed want to do that but he seems serious. He;s been using the terminal a lot.\n\n"
