  displayText: "21-Offense\n----------------------\n\nCONDITIONS: Believed to have splintered off from its cousin Assurance, Offense features similar jagged and dry conditions but differs in its ecosystem.\n\nHISTORY: 21-Offense is categorized as an asteroid moon and seems to have not existed on its own for more than several hundred years. The industrial artifacts here have suffered damage; it's believed they were built long before 21-Offense was splintered off.\n\nFAUNA: A competitive and toughened ecosystem supports aggressive lifeforms. Travellers to 21-Offense should know it's not for the faint of heart.\n\n"
