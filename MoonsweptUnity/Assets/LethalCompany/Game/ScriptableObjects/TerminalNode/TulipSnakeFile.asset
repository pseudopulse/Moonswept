  displayText: "Tulip Snakes\n\nSigurd's danger level: 1%\n\nScientific name: Draco tulipa\nTulip snakes, or tulip lizards, are a type of flying lizard which are easily distinguished by their long arms and wings, which can reach twice the size of other members of their genus (Draco) and sport unusually bright colors and patterns. Their name comes from the flaps under their neck and behind their head, which resemble large flower petals. (Their other unusual characteristics include an extra pair of eyes and a deeply forked tail.)\n\nTheir behaviour is stubborn and fearless to a fault. Indeed, tulip snakes will rarely flee a predator. But ironically, many biologists theorize that their flowery appearance aids them more as a camoflauge than an intimidation display. It also takes an important part in their elaborate courtship rituals, which are more similar to that of birds. \n\nUniquely, lifting heavy and large objects into the air has often been observed as a part of the tulip snake's mating display; they are capable of carrying rocks and plants at least twice their size in an effort to impress their potential mate. Protective, jealous, and in a frenzy, the males may end up in tug-of-war fights over objects they take a liking to, which can even include other living creatures."
