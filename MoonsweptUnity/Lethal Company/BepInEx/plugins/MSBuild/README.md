Cleaning drones are small, aerial machines that were built to handle infestation within the facilities. They slowly roam around the building, dispensing a fog of highly concentrated TZP chemicals. The purpose of this fog was to kill invasive insects, however, they seem to have long since grown resistant to it, even using it to their advantage at times as a place to hide.

When first encountering this machine, we saw tons of thick fog, so we decided to take a risk and venture through it. We couldn’t see a thing,  and we could barely breathe. It seems to give a much stronger effect compared to our TZP inhalers, and we struggled to walk well after. Once we got to the other side of the fog, we encountered the cleaner, releasing the gas as it sporadically flew around. When one of us struck the machine, it released a large amount of the chemical and quickly darted away.

There seems to be no evidence of who made these devices.

This joke of a machine is what I've come to call the Mobile Turret.

It patrols the halls of the facilities, beaming a red spotlight from the tip of its barrel. It aimlessly roams around, until it spots a person. Once it gets within a short range of its target, it stops moving, aims, then starts firing. Thankfully, it’s much weaker in damage and slower to lock on than a normal turret. However, the turret also seems to have a tighter, longer range than its stationary counterpart, able to gun down entire an entire hallway. It seems to stop attempting to aim once it begins firing, just shooting indiscriminately in that direction. However, still keep your guard up around this thing, for if you underestimate it, your life may come to an end quickly.

The exterior of the machine seems to be identical to the stationary turrets we find around the facilities, and its mobile mount has no identifying information on who may have modified it.
