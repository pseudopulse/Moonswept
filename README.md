S.D.L (Sigurd’s Danger Level): 5%

The Cleaners are small, aerial machines that were built to handle infestation within the facilities. They slowly roam around the building, dispensing a fog of highly concentrated TZP chemicals. The purpose of this fog was to kill invasive insects, however they seem to have long since grown resistant to it, even using it to their advantage at times as a place to hide.

When first encountering this machine, we saw tons of thick fog, so we decided to take a risk and venture through it. We couldn’t see a thing,  and we could barely breathe. It seems to give a much stronger effect compared to our TZP inhalers, and we struggled to walk well after. Once we got to the other side of the fog, we encountered the cleaner, releasing the gas as it sporadically flew around. When one of us struck the machine, it released a large amount of the chemical and quickly darted away.

There seems to be no evidence of who made these devices.
